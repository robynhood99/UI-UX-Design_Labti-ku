**UI-UX-Design_Labti-ku**

## **PROJECT DESCRIPTION**
This project is based on my scientific paper, where I developed the 'Labti-ku' application. The app was created to allow students who missed lab sessions to submit online memos, eliminating the need for them to visit the office in person.

## **FILE STRUCTURE**
1. **LABTI-ku Project.pdf**: This file contains the UI/UX design, including wireframes and mockups of the Labti-ku application.
2. **Link Portofoliio.txt**: This file contains a Figma link to view the wireframe, mockup, and even the prototype of the Labti-ku application design.
3. **Portofolio UIUX_Robby Nugraha.pdf**: This file contains the definition and results of the Labti-ku application design.
4. **LABTI-ku Project.fig**: This is a Figma file to view the design directly by importing the file into Figma.

## **Technologies Used**
- Figma: For design UI/UX from wireframe, mockup, until protoype.
- PowerPoint: For presenting result UI/UX Design Labti-ku App.

## **Usage Guide**
- Cloning Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine with the command: `git clone https://github.com/robynhood99/UIUX-Design_Labti-ku.git`
- Open Link Portofolio.txt: Open the notepad file and copy-paste the Figma link to view the UI/UX design of the Labti-ku application.
- View Result in pdf file or figma file: Open the PDF or Figma file to view the UI/UX design of the Labti-ku application.


## **Conclusion**
The Labti-ku application is designed to be fairly easy to use and understandable for users, with colors that match the university's theme. For future development, you are welcome to redesign or use the file for personal learning.
